## Demeter Garden Watering System

Demeter is an open-source project founded by Michal Harakal. It is based on a Raspberry PI with Android Things image and a relay board attached, which controls water valves for garden watering. An Android App is used to connect via LAN and steer the valves and setup switching schedules.
